{"id": "c5039", "nl_problem": "An integer partition of a positive integer $n$ is a finite non-increasing sequence of positive integers $\\left(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_k\\right)$ whose sum is equal to $n$. The integers $\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_k$ are called the parts of the partition. For example, the number of partitions of the integer $n=4$ is 5, which are $(4), (3, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1)$. A generalization of integer partitions is the overpartition of $n$, which is a partition of $n$ where each part may be overlined upon its first occurrence. For example, $n=4$ has $14$ overpartitions: $(4), \\left(\\bar{4}\\right),\\left(3,1\\right),\\left(\\bar{3},1\\right),\\left(3,\\bar{1}\\right),\\left(\\bar{3},\\bar{1}\\right),\\left(2,2\\right),\\left(\\bar{2},2\\right),(2, 1, 1), \\left(\\bar{2},1,1\\right), \\left(2,\\bar{1},1\\right), \\left(\\bar{2},\\bar{1},1\\right), (1, 1, 1, 1), \\left(\\bar{1},1,1,1\\right)$. The number of overpartitions of $n$ is usually denoted by $\\bar{p}\\left(n\\right)$; from the above, we can see that $\\bar{p}\\left(4\\right)=14$. The family of functions $\\bar{R_l^*}\\left(n\\right)$ counts the number of overpartitions of weight $n$ such that non-overlined parts are not allowed to be divisible by $l$, while there is no restriction on overlined parts. For example, the overpartitions counted by $\\bar{R_3^*}\\left(4\\right)$ are 12: $(4), \\left(\\bar{4}\\right), \\left(\\bar{3},1\\right), \\left(\\bar{3},\\bar{1}\\right), (2, 2), \\left(\\bar{2},2\\right),(2, 1, 1), \\left(\\bar{2},1,1\\right), \\left(2,\\bar{1},1\\right), \\left(\\bar{2},\\bar{1},1\\right), (1, 1, 1, 1), \\left(\\bar{1},1,1,1\\right)$. We can easily see that the two overpartitions counted by $\\overline{p}\\left(4\\right) $, namely $\\left(3,1\\right)$ and $\\left(3,\\overline{1}\\right)$, do not appear in the list above. This is because they contain a non-overlined part divisible by $l= 3$. The function $\\bar{R_l^*}\\left(n\\right)$ satisfies a series of congruence properties. For each $l$, this function satisfies the following generating function identity: $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{\\bar{R_l^*}\\left(n\\right)q^n}=\\frac{f_2f_l}{f_1^2}$.
